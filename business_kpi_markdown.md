## Air Quality & Flu Surveillance Data Pipeline – Project Summary

### 1. Stakeholders & Value

**"Shifting decisions from reactive to proactive"**

### Target Audience

### Group 1: Healthcare-focused Non-Profits and Government Agencies

**Organizations monitoring public health trends, disease outbreaks, and environmental health impacts.**

Use Case & Value:

	•	Quickly identify flu outbreaks in specific states or age groups

	•	Facilitate reporting to government agencies, municipalities, and public health officials

	•	Support timely interventions in vulnerable populations, particularly children and the elderly

	•	Enable cross-analysis of environmental factors and health outcomes for preventative measures

### Group 2: Outdoor Activity and Tourism Businesses

**Businesses such as bike rental services, outdoor tours, sports centers, or event organizers.**

**Especially, after COVID the population became even more sensitive in the case of influenza**

Use Case & Value:

	•	Forecast potential reductions in customer visits due to poor air quality or high flu rates

	•	Plan business operations and staffing based on environmental and health trends

	•	Develop targeted marketing strategies or alerts for customers based on safe outdoor conditions

    •   Potentially plan online engagement content for keeping the customers active 

#

### Business Benefits

	•	Improved decision-making: quick identification of high-risk periods or regions

	•	Revenue optimization: businesses can forecast and understand low-demand periods linked to environmental or      health conditions

	•	Data-driven reporting: consolidated dashboards and analyses reduce manual reporting efforts

    •	Stronger public health response: help health agencies plan and take action during flu outbreaks

## 2. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

**1. Correlation Between Air Quality and Flu Rates**

    • Identify populations or regions where environmental factors make flu outbreaks worse for targeted interventions

    • Anticipate periods where both pollution and flu might reduce customer visits; plan safety alerts or adjust outdoor offerings

    • Enables evidence-based reporting to government or municipal authorities about environmental health risks

**2. Outlier detection (weeks with exceptionally high AQI or flu rates)**

    • Catch environmental and epidemiological outbreak

    • Suggest intervention to underperforming facilities
	
**3. Behavioral Adaptation Based Marketing**

    • Adjust services, promotions, and communication to maintain engagement and revenue despite environmental and/or health risks

    • Enables data-driven marketing strategies that respond to real world conditions

    • Supports customer safety and satisfaction, strengthening brand trust
